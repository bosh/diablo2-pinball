# Diablo 2 Pinball

Enter the Chaos Sanctuary and defeat the Lord of Terror!

------

Features:

* Game rules based on health and mana resource usage, not your standard 3-ball pinball ruleset
* Battle through Normal, Nightmare, and Hell difficulties for an evolving challenge
* QR-code based save states so you can keep your progress between sessions
* Large painted busts of Diablo and Tyreal as well as models of the five original classes from D2
* Play as the Hammerdin - a Paladin variant that combines spinning hammers with powerful auras to defeat all foes
* Sounds from the video game -- you'll feel like you're right back in 2000!
